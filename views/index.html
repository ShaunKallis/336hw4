		        <p>Companion robots are the next step in the service industry</p> 
		        <p>They will play games with people, tell jokes and be entertaining, watch the game with you and cheer for your team or watch a sad movie and empathize.  
		        They will listen to how your day was and offer advice if solicited.  They will help raise children and nurse the elderly.  They will provide sexual outlets to the frustrated.  They will care for the sick without risk of being infected or spreading infection. </p>
		        <p>They will provide conversation to people in bars and clubs and casinos.  They will be available as needed as babysitters or therapists or prostitues or live in nurses. </p>
